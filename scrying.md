#Scrying
- gaze into some object or surface and receive information from a light transendent state
- trick mind into a meditative state to see vision on surface
- always go into scrying with a question in mind to not get something you don't want 
- can scry into dark liquid
- can scry into ceiling
- can scry into fire, incents, water, earth
- stare into surface with a blurred vision and look into the center of the object instead of through it
