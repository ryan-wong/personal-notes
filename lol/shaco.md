###Playstyle
1. Objective Shaco: Want to have good single target damage to destroy objectives, and carry
2. Splitpush Shaco: Want to do split push, not about assasinations. Don't split push if you can't push very fast. IF you split and get tower, you can get team back the gold you lost in team fight.Otherwise, not worth split pushing.
