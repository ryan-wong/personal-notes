#Mobile game maker
- need to release multiple titles before google starts helping you link your games together for people to find
- making the game is easier, making the GDD(Game design document) is the hard part
- should design the first 5min of the game and test it to see if people like it before completing it
- for rpg game, just make it in html5 and do a cordova app for it since you don't need particle accelerator in app and its easier to port to all platforms
- making shop and ads in html5 game is not as hard as you think
- most important is the game needs to be fun, most work is on designer and script writer
- should have a team of tool developers not game developers to be efficent, designers should be able to tweak script to change game
- most game development is waterfall GDD driven
- need to release 40 titles before being called a game studio
- need to release all 40 titles under you company name
- need a good business plan on how you market your game get more people to play it
- most games are really just 1 simple task, someone breaks a game by cheating and adding rules till a full game
- most people are cheap they will wait for sale before buying the game at 1$ or less
- if only java, consider making the game in java and port it to android or writing it in C++ and port it, you can use unity but its a bit messed up
